            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Sham PRINCE Expos'd. In a Dialogue between the <hi>Popes Nuncio and Bricklayers Wife.</hi> Nurſe to the Suppoſed <hi>PRINCE</hi> of <hi>WALES.</hi>
            </head>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nurſe</speaker>
               <p>AH! Father <hi>Nuncio,</hi> what woful times are theſe we live in; and how diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from thoſe, when every day laid the Foundation of a Chappel and almoſt all Profeſſions both in Church and State, imploy'd in Converting either Houſes or Perſons to the Service of <hi>Mother Church?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nuncio.</speaker>
               <p>Why, truly Daughter, the Alterations are not much greater than we have heard or ſeen in former times. And as we have ſtill found the <hi>Mother of God</hi> ready to help us at a dead lift, ſo I don't doubt but this will make one Saints ſet her on her Son, to demand Reſtitution.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nurſe.</speaker>
               <p>Well, You may flatter your ſelves with Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but your ſatisfaction is likely to be no greater than a Hungry Mans Dream of a plentiful Supper: Your late ſhort Scene of Glory was like the laſt Blaze of a Candle, ſpent in the Socket; and the unmannerly <hi>Whigs</hi> think it has left as bad a ſtink behind it too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nun.</speaker>
               <p>Come, come, Child, we have a reſerve yet left, what, do you think a Council of <hi>Jeſuits</hi> can be out-witted by a <hi>Dutch man.</hi> I can but laugh to think what a thorn in their Sides our young Prince <hi>Pretty-man</hi> will prove.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nurſe.</speaker>
               <p>O Lord Sir, Now the whole Kingdom laughs at the Sham; and there's neyer a Joyner in Town but has a Pattern of the <hi>Bed-ſtead:</hi> Nay, next <hi>Bartholomew-Fair</hi> they intend to have a Droll, call'd, <hi>The Tragedy of</hi> Perkin Warbeck; you have read the Story of that <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin,</hi> Sir, have not you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nun.</speaker>
               <p>And what of all this? Do you think ten years Conſultation in the Conclave, a French Army, and his Holineſs's Bleſſing, cannnot ſufficiently enable us to bring about a far Deſign of greater difficulty than this? But What do the People ſay of it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nurſe.</speaker>
               <p>Why they ſay the Queen lay under ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances at the time of the report of her Conception, that not all the Stallions in <hi>Europe</hi> could have got her with Child; nay, they ſay neither the <hi>Iriſh Champion,</hi> nor the <hi>Italian Count,</hi> no nor the ſtrongeſt Backs in <hi>Covent Garden</hi> could have done it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nun.</speaker>
               <p>Nay to ſpeak the Truth between you and I, we choſe a bad time, but we thought the very Notion of a Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> would make ſuch a noiſe, as Would drown all Probability and Reaſon; beſides, who thought People would have been ſo uncivil, to peep as it were under the Queens Cloaths or Queſtion the Word of a King.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nurſe.</speaker>
               <p>Tis true, theſe <hi>Church of England Whigs</hi> are ſo Inquiſitive (forſooth) that the Queen never went to Piſs, but they'd be caſting of her Water. Well I am ſure to have loſt a good Bargain of it: Oh! I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hear ſuch ſweet Muſick again, as the ratling of Guinea's every now and then in my hand; Beſide, the Honourable Title of the <hi>Prince of Wale</hi>'s Nurſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nun</speaker>
               <p>By our lady, you're in the right of it, nothing troubles me ſo much as the loſs of my Penſion; for tho 'tis our Buſineſs to look Grave and Demure; yet by our Bulk you may gueſs we take no delight in Starving.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nurſe.</speaker>
               <p>But Sir, is there no way to get another <hi>Prince of Wales;</hi> for ſo I might be Nurſe, I did not care if there was a new One every Year. It paſſes for Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that the Queen's big again of a Duke of <hi>York:</hi> When do you think ſhe'll be brought to Bed?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nun.</speaker>
               <p>O Lord, do you think ſhe'd be mad to lye in theſe troubleſome times; beſides the very noiſe of the <hi>Dutch Soldiers</hi> would ſpoil her Milk, as Thunder does Ale; for She's reſolv'd to Suckle the next herſelf, to prevent Suſpition; and you know (as the Ladies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd) She has abundance of Milk always, after being with Child of a Son.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nurſe.</speaker>
               <p>Well Sir, I wiſh I could ſee it, but all the Proteſtant Aſtrologers fore-tell ſhe'll mis-carry: And O my Conſcience, I believe they're a ſort of Conjurers, for they Calculate every thing to a Hairs breadth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nun.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, nay, now you talk of Conjurers I can fit you: I am ſure I and my Brethren foretold things ſo miraculous, that few or none could believe them, till they ſaw them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nurſe.</speaker>
               <p>Nor then neither, may be.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nun.</speaker>
               <p>Did not our <hi>Roman Almanacks</hi> ſpeak of the Queens being to be with Child, at leaſt half a Year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'twas ſaid ſhe was conceived? Did we not declare it muſt be a Prince of <hi>Wales?</hi> nay we could have told you the very time and place too, but that we fear'd the Chamber would have been crowded with Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and that would have troubled her worſe than her Labour: For we had Prognoſticated before, that the Preſence of a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Biſhop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would be very Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious and Hurtful to the Birth of a Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nurſe.</speaker>
               <p>Tis very true Sir, you and your Society ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many Prophecies: But the deſign and meaning of them were ſo plain and obvious to every Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it detracted much from the reverence of them: I have been told, your Ancient Oracles were deliver'd like Riddles, and conſequently not liable to every mean interpretation; and though we all acknowledge'd the News of the Queens being certainly with Child of a Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> as a ſort of a Myſtery, yet by compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few Caſes, we eaſily unravell'd the whole Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nun.</speaker>
               <p>Well, well, we ſhall play you another Game ere long: But tell me how do the People think of the King in this matter?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nurſe.</speaker>
               <p>Why they that are Moderate amongſt them, think he was ſo fond of the very Notion of having a Son in his Old Age, that in a little time he might have been (good man) deluded into the belief of it; as ſome have us'd themſelves to tell a Lye ſo often, that at laſt they have been perſwaded that it was true: Others think the Queen wore the Breeches ſo long, that His Majeſty durſt not venture to unbutton them, or try the truth of the Matter: But the more general, and more probable Opinion, is, that being led by a Zeal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed chiefly by you and your Worſhipful Society, he thought the merie of the Act, in relation to his Church, would ballance the Stain which the diſmal Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof would certainly imprint on his Memory and Reputation. And the thoughts of this, if you had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Grain of Conſcience, Religion; or Honeſty (which is very much diſpair'd of in men of your Profeſſion) ſhould touch your Hearts, with either Shame of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, for ſo black a deſign of Suppreſſing the Church, ruining State, and murthering more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and conſcientious men, than all your boaſted Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality can ſhow.</p>
